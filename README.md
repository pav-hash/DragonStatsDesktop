# DragonStatsDesktop
Windows desktop version of Dragon Stats

This is a donationware project.  If you use it, donate.  Its that simple.

This app requires .net framwork 4.5+ installed on your system.  The installer will NOT
install this for you, as most all recent versions of windows come standard with .net framework
pre-installed.

INSTALL and SETUP:
1) run the installer.  By default it will install in 'C:\DragonStatsDesktop'
2) once installed, run DragonStats.exe and click on the 'Settings' button
3) enter your base subnet into the 'network subnet' (ie. if your ip address is 192.168.0.4, enter ONLY 192.168.0. )
4) make sure your miners administrator username and passwords are correct (this is needed for api access)
5) save setting
6) press the 'Rescan Network' button

This has been tested and running, so if there are any issues, verify your settings information first.
If all seems correct, open up a issue on this git and I will try and trace down the issue.

NOTE:  This app is for controlling dragonmint miners only (ie. T1, B29, B52, D9, T2 ).  It may/will
display info for antminers, but will NOT control them.
